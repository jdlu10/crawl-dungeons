# CRAWL DUNGEONS

Retro 2.5D dungeon crawler game made with the following technology/frameworks:

- React
- Zustand
- Tailwind
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Github
- AWS EC2

Demo: [http://crawl-dungeons.jdlu.com/](http://crawl-dungeons.jdlu.com/).

This webapp is made with Ruby on Rails handing routing and the API endpoints with data stored in PostgreSQL. The webapp and DB are dockerized and are hosted in 2 different AWS EC2 instances, using Github actions for continuous deployment. Frontend is built in React with Tailwind for CSS. Zustand is used for state management.

This is still a work in progress, more features would get added over time.
